::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the relationship between knowledge and trust
- Understand why reproducible research builds trust in our work

We write research papers to contribute knowledge, insights, or perspectives to a field of study. By publishing in a peer reviewed journal, we ask our audience to believe in what we say, to accept that the knowledge we have created is true.

But how does our audience know this? A number of mechanisms are already in place to support this. Peer review, citations, acceptance into a reputable journal all add support into a paper. 

Another way we ensure our research creditibility is reproducibility - can someone repeat your work and end up at the same conclusion? Knowledge should be reproducible, 

This also has the added benefit of encouraging reuse of the data and research methods - with research being a costly exercise, often at government (and general public) expense, producing quality results and enabling reuse is our responsibilty to the world. 

The digital age brings us both benefits and dangers. While we have the knowledge of the world at our fingertips, sifting through the buzz to find the knowledge is difficult and nuanced. With all the information on the internet and social media, how do people know what to trust?

Part of what we will talk about in these lessons is trust. How do we show that our research, the knowledge we have created, is trustworthy? 

Aligned to that, how do we retain this knowledge in the long term, so it can be trusted and reused in the future?
