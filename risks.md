Please note, this thought exercise is not comprehensive of all risks, and it is best to talk to the relevant authority in your organisation for a full risk assessment.

## What are risks


## Why should you consider risks



## What to do about risks



Avoid - Can this risk be avoided? For example, if your research is dependant on one single machine, can you buy a second machine?

Transfer - Can you transfer this risk? For example, when moving buildings, instead of asking staff to carry furniture, you can hire a moving company.

Minimise - Can you minimise this risk? For example, if there was another COVID outbreak, are you prepared for your staff to work from home, even though you may only operate at 70% capacity. Are proper procedures in place in the lab to minimise virus transfer, such as air filtration systems?

Accept - There are times you cannot do anything about that risk, so you must accept it may happen. For example, a flight may be cancelled that you were relying on, with no alternate transport options available.
