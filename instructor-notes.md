## Considerations about this course material

This training was written with a few things in mind:

- There is little RR training for those that are not doing computational based research. This course attempts to offer skills that are not coding-focused, so that a wider range of people can use them. While we do offer opportunities to introduce the idea of coding, we wanted to make this course inclusive to all disciplines and all levels of technical literacy. 

- People are in different stages and maturities on any topic. To make them feel welcome and comfortable, we highlight that this training won't make them an expert, and we don't expect them to have background knowledge. This training is moreso about helping them further down the path. We wrote the courses so that for each area, everyone should be able to walk away with an action item to improve their processes.

- There are some RR improvements that need to happen in a bigger scale, such as the 'publish or perish' affect on reproducibility. We can't solve the world's problems today, but we can help the people in front of us, and that matters.

#### Different terminology and disciplines may respond differently

Thereâ€™s a discussion to be had here on different terminology. Where a biologist may talk about a protocol, a humanities researcher may talk more of analysis, and a data scientist may talk about their code or pipeline.

The UKRN hosted a webinar on "Reproducibility, Transparency, Positionality?  Perspectives From Different Research Fields" that may be a helpful resource. The [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XaBkhs9yFg) and [slides](https://osf.io/mgqra/) are available.
