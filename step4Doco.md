"Documentation is a love letter to your future self" - Damian Conway

Think about this scenerio:

A key person from your research group suddenly disappears without warning or notice. 
How does this affect your work? 
How does this affect your research group?

Talk about that this scenerio does happen. There could be a medical emergency such as a stroke or heart attack. They could have won the lotto. Or even been offered a fantastic opportunity overseas with little time to transfer.

Any personal stories here can also be useful if you have them, and are comfortable to share.

# Activity time

Let's document how to make a pizza! 

Get a piece of paper and write down how you would do it. You'll need what ingredients you've used, and to write how you've made it.

If you're in a classroom, get them to then stick them on the wall.

In a virtual setting, you can put people in break out rooms and share them there, or put them in a chat or shared google doc etc.

5 Minutes. - Done.

Okay, so firstly, let's talk about our Base.

Assumely, you included a base. But did you describe it? Was it thin or thick pan? Extra wide New York style?

If you're Australian, there's a good chance you included pineapple on your pizza. 


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

You can ask participants to put their hand up if they had:
- A base in their ingredients
- Described what type of base (gf, thick, thin, bought, home made)
- Described how to obtain the base (did they make it from scratch, did they talk about a bought base etc)

Watch the hands go up and slowly come down.

If you really want to be a bit dad joke/cheesy ha, you can play "All about the bass" as a 'pencils down' alarm after your 5 minutes.
