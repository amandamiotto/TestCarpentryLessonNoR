"Documentation is a love letter to your future self" - Damian Conway

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We've talked about writing down or noting a lot of information .... but where do we do this? How? 



Think about this scenerio:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

#### A key person from your research group suddenly disappears without warning or notice. 


How does this affect your work? 
How does this affect your research group?

Talk about that this scenerio does happen. There could be a medical emergency such as a stroke or heart attack. They could have won the lotto. Or even been offered a fantastic opportunity overseas with little time to transfer.

Any personal stories here can also be useful if you have them, and are comfortable to share.

# How to start documenting

Who is this documentation aimed at? Who is your audience? Your future self? Your lab group? Your reviewers?

Let's document how to make a pizza! 

Get a piece of paper and write down how you would do it. You'll need what ingredients you've used, and to write how you've made it. 

Give yourself 3 minutes.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
If you're in a classroom, get them to then stick them on the wall.

In a virtual setting, you can put people in break out rooms and share them there, or put them in a chat or shared google doc etc.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Okay, so firstly, let's talk about our Base.

Assumely, you included a base. But did you describe it? Was it thin or thick pan? Extra wide New York style?

What was the base made out of? 

Now, the default answer here is dough. BUT here's the thing - not everyone may have the same idea about what 'could' constitute a pizza base.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

You can ask participants to put their hand up if they had:
- A base in their ingredients
- Described what type of base (gf, thick, thin, bought, home made)
- Described how to obtain the base (did they make it from scratch, did they talk about a bought base etc)

Watch the hands go up and slowly come down.

If you really want to be a bit dad joke/cheesy ha, you can play "All about the bass" as a 'pencils down' alarm after your 3 minutes.

## Story Time
By @amandamiotto

So one day during a work lunch, a colleague made a passing comment about having a cauliflower pizza. This erupted a spicy debate on ***'Is this a pizza?'***.

Further questions revealed they weren't using cauliflower as a topping - Their version of a pizza was a roasted slice of cauliflower as a base, topped with tomato sauce, pizza toppings and cheese.

There was much debate - Surely this wasn't a pizza, there was no base! But can a base be a slice of cauliflower? Should a base be a dough? Was this just a vegetable stack?

This lead to the coversation of what a base must consist of. 

***Does a base need to contain flour?*** If so, does a mix of egg, parmasan cheese and almond flour meet the criteria? Almond flour is a flour after all.

***Does a base need to be a yeast based dough?*** If so, take the scenerio that someone used a naan as a base - if they made a yeast based naan, it would be pizza, but a yogurt based naan wouldn't? 





### Details are important!



#### This shows that while we have assumptions on what is 'normal', this is skewed by our life experience, and others may not have the same 'normal'.

## Another Example - Pineapple on Pizza

If you're Australian, there's a good chance you included pineapple on your pizza. Pineapple is a common ingredient on a range of Australian pizzas, and may even accompany a Barbeque sauce in place of a tomato passata or olive oil.

In fact, Hawaiian (ham, pineapple and cheese) was the most popular pizza in Australia in 1999, accounting for 15% of pizza sales. Hawaiian Pizza was even named after the brand of canned pineapple initially used when the Hawaiian pizza was first created (by a Greek cook in Canada, inspired by the sweet and sour combination of asian dishes). 

However, if you come from Italy, none of the traditional pizzas would contain pineapple. So if you had to make a Hawaiian pizza for the first time, you may have some questions.

- Do you leave the skin on?

- Do you cut it in slices or chunks? How big?

- Do you cook the pineapple first?


We may underestimate or forget the extent of background knowledge we have on various topics.

## The Curse of Knowledge

May also be referenced as Expert Bias or Curse of Expertise

"The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, who is communicating with others, assumes that others have information that is only available to themselves, assuming they all share a background and understanding."

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### When explaining a concept, we assume that others have the same background knowledge and life experiences that we do. However, ***this is rarely true***. 

Take for example, explaining how to create a new entry into a spreadsheet. You may focus on what needs to change in that spreadsheet- however, you have assumed that they have the knowledge to:

- Know how to alter a spreadsheet

- Understand what 'tab' that information is under

- Know where the spreadsheet is stored; is it in a shared drive, in a cloud hosted platform, from an email etc.

- How this may affect any formatting or automated calculations


Let's stand on the other side:
Have you ever had the experience where you have asked someone more computer-savvy than yourself how to set up a printer? Their first words may be "It's easy, you just go....", then explain in a sentence something that doesn't make any sense?

They may have made the assumption you know:

- What a driver is

- Where to install it

- If and how it connects to your wifi

- Where to find the printer settings on your computer

A good opportunity to give a personal experience here. Even as someone who works in IT, this happens to me often.

Another scenerio 

#### You are contacted about a paper you published 2 years ago, as a similar paper was published with contradicting results. 

How do you show your workings?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Thankfully, we can now do this! We can refer to our notes with our detailed methods, analysis pipelines and have links to where our data is backed up (from Lesson 1)
