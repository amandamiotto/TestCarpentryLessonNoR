# Preparing your research for reuse

[Project completion checklist](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Project_completion.md) by @cbahlai licenced under Public Domain


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Does your institute have a 'Once your project is done' checklist?

May be worth checking with your library or research office.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

## Deposit your final dataset and protocol/analysis pipeline

### FAIR vs Open vs Can't share

https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/

Sharing under a data transfer agreement?
What does your ethics/governance/research contract say?

https://ardc.edu.au/resource/publishing-sensitive-data-guide/


#### Mitigating the risk when sharing data

https://github.com/cbahlai/OSRR_course/blob/master/15_sharing_data.md


### Where to deposit?

Deposit final state data to support your publications in an
institutional or discipline data repository which can mint a DOI and
create a citation for your work.

https://ardc.edu.au/resource/guide-to-choosing-a-data-repository/

[Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
[Re3Data](https://www.re3data.org/)
[PLOSone Recommended Repositories](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories)

Can you also publish your raw data?

#### Publishing negative results

Positively Negative– a section of PLOS One specifically designed for studies that have negative results, but which are still of high quality and make a significant contribution to the field.

The Missing Pieces: A Collection of Negative; Null and Inconclusive Results– a section of PLOS One that is a broader collection of negative, null, and inconclusive results. The section accepts studies that do not meet the criteria for Positively Negative, but which still have the potential to be informative and valuable to the scientific community.

Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis

The All Results Journals– focuses on recovering and publishing negative results, valuable pieces of information in Chemistry, Nanotechnology, Biology, or Physics.


# What could you include when publishing

Wood-Charlson EM, Crockett Z, Erdmann C, Arkin AP, Robinson CB (2022) Ten simple rules for getting and giving credit for data. PLoS Comput Biol 18(9): e1010476. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010476

Have limitations of the study been noted and justified/discussed?

Reflective statements where the researchers consider how their own Bias /priviledges/worldviews may impact the findings

# Permanent Identifiers

Identifiers vs Persistent Identifiers

Identifiers

URLs
Barcodes


Management not guaranteed:
links
disappear
websites
shut down
product
support ends

Persistant Identifiers
DOI
ORCID

Reword this:

	DOI key messages:
	DOIs are the globally accepted identification standard for digital  scholarly publications, detailing the necessary metadata to support  credit and attribution.
	DOIs can be created for datasets and associated outputs (e.g. grey  literature, workflows, algorithms, software etc.) - DOIs for data are  equivalent to DOIs for other scholarly publications
	DOIs enable accurate data citation and bibliometrics (both metrics and altmetrics)
	Resolvable DOIs provide easy online access to research data for discovery, attribution and reuse
	Dataset DOIs can be linked using standard metadata schemas to  other research output, increasing opportunities to reproduce research.
	A trusted repository will mint one for you.

Management guaranteed over time:
links find the object even when websites
change


A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string that
identifies content and provides a persistent link to its location on the
internet

Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic versions of individual
articles & datasets.
