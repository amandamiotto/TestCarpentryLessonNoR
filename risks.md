Please note, this thought exercise is not comprehensive of all risks, and it is best to talk to the relevant authority in your organisation for a full risk assessment.

## What are risks?

Risks are when something could go wrong, and have a negative affect on your work. 



## Why should you consider risks?

By considering where things could go wrong, it gives us an opportunity to put measures in place to safeguard ourselves and be a little more ready.

Risks can also have the possibility to turn into opportunities.

For example, when businesses moved to the 'Work from home' model, to minimise the risk of workers contracting COVID in the workplace, it opened up the opportunity for this to become normalised. This could save workplaces in office space costs, enable people to work from home when they need to accept deliveries or need to stay home for a reason and gives staff the space to use their lunch breaks in different ways.


## What to do about risks?

There are a number of steps we can take to handle risks.


***Avoid*** - Can this risk be avoided? For example, if your research is dependant on one single machine, can you buy a second machine?

***Transfer*** - Can you transfer this risk? For example, when moving buildings, instead of asking staff to carry furniture, you can hire a moving company.

***Minimise*** - Can you minimise this risk? For example, if there was another COVID outbreak, are you prepared for your staff to work from home, even though you may only operate at 70% capacity. Are proper procedures in place in the lab to minimise virus transfer, such as air filtration systems?

***Accept*** - There are times you cannot do anything about that risk, so you must accept it may happen. For example, a flight may be cancelled that you were relying on, with no alternate transport options available.


## What types of risks are there?

### External Risks

We can use the PESTEL model to consider External Risks

A great resource to learn more about PESTEL can be found on the [free textbook website Openstax](https://openstax.org/books/principles-management/pages/8-3-a-firms-external-macro-environment-pestel).



### Internal Risks

There are a number of risks to consider that can come from inside your organisation or research group.

- Partnerships
- Information and document management Risks
- Financial Risks
- Operational Risks
- Human Resources Risks
- Strategic Risk
- Privacy Risks

Let's use [this risk template](episodes/fig/RiskTemplate.pdf) to consider our team risks.
