# For each activity, here is what you need to prepare. 


## Step 2 - Clean a spreadsheet

Have a spreadsheet that has some messy data in it to clean. You can ask everyone to write down two changes they would make, then have an interactive session where you ask people to suggest their changes.

### To prepare

Have a dirty dataset - there's a few online if you google. I've made a git issue for this, that may be a good activity for a beginner instructor to try out.


## Step 4 - Missing team member

Ask people to pick someone they interact with regularly (supervisor, student, collaborator). Then ask them, if contact to this person was completely cut off, what information would they need to know to continue their own work?

### To prepare

Have some suggested answers prepared. For example:
- Where is the raw data?
- Where is the research contracts stored?
- What's the latest analysis pipeline?


## Step 4 - Document a Pizza

Ask people to write how to make a pizza.

### To prepare

You could pull down a recipe from online to critique. If you're in person, having some way for people to stick their pizza recipies to the wall would be useful.

## Step 4 - Egg on pizza

ow assume you are making a pizza someone else has ordered. They've asked for egg on their pizza. How do you do it?

No real prep needed, this is more a discussion.

## Step 4 - Contacted for details

You are contacted about a paper you published 2 years ago, as a similar paper was published with contradicting results.
How do you show your workings?


No real prep needed, discussion.
