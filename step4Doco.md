"Documentation is a love letter to your future self" - Damian Conway

Think about this scenerio:

A key person from your research group suddenly disappears without warning or notice. 
How does this affect your work? 
How does this affect your research group?

Talk about that this scenerio does happen. There could be a medical emergency such as a stroke or heart attack. They could have won the lotto. Or even been offered a fantastic opportunity overseas with little time to transfer.

Any personal stories here can also be useful if you have them, and are comfortable to share.

Let's document how to make a pizza! 

Get a piece of paper and write down how you would do it. You'll need what ingredients you've used, and to write how you've made it.

If you're in a classroom, get them to then stick them on the wall.

In a virtual setting, you can put people in break out rooms and share them there, or put them in a chat or shared google doc etc.

5 Minutes. - Done.

Okay, so firstly, let's talk about our Base.

Assumely, you included a base. But did you describe it? Was it thin or thick pan? Extra wide New York style?

What was the base made out of? 

Now, the default answer here is dough. BUT here's the thing - not everyone may have the same idea about what 'could' constitute a pizza base.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Story Time

So one day during a work lunch, a colleague made a passing comment about having a cauliflower pizza. This erupted a spicy debate on 'Is this a pizza?'.

Further questions revealed they weren't using cauliflower as a topping - Their version of a pizza was a roasted slice of cauliflower as a base, topped with tomato sauce, pizza toppings and cheese.

There was much debate - Surely this wasn't a pizza, there was no base! But can a base be a slice of cauliflower? Should it be a bread or a dough? Was this just a vegetable stack?

This lead to the coversation of what a base must consist of. 

Does a base need to contain flour? If so, does a mix of egg, parmasan cheese and almond flour meet the criteria? Almond flour is a flour after all.

Does a base need to be a yeast based dough? If so, take the scenerio that someone used a naan as a base - if they made a yeast based naan, it would be pizza, but a yogurt based naan wouldn't? 

## Details are important!

#### This shows that while we have assumptions on what is 'normal', this is skewed by our life experience, and others may not have the same 'normal'.

If you're Australian, there's a good chance you included pineapple on your pizza.

You can ask participants to put their hand up if they had:
- A base in their ingredients
- Described what type of base (gf, thick, thin, bought, home made)
- Described how to obtain the base (did they make it from scratch, did they talk about a bought base etc)

Watch the hands go up and slowly come down.

If you really want to be a bit dad joke/cheesy ha, you can play "All about the bass" as a 'pencils down' alarm after your 5 minutes.
