One of the top reasons that reproducibility studies failed was the lack of detail in methodology and protocols. It is also one of the topics that came up again and again when interviewing researchers on how they judged whether a paper was trustworthy.

There's a discussion to be had here on different terminology. Where a biologist may talk about a protocol, a humanities researcher may talk more of analysis, and a data scientist may talk about their code or pipeline.

# Transparent Methodologies and Protocols

Clarity in your methodology is important, and can offer an insight into how you've reduced bias in your research. Has that methodology come from a different area of the discipline? If so, why was it adopted?

Have you described your protocols in depth? Part of being reproducible is explaining your steps in such depth that someone can replicate your work.

Have you explained why you chose that protocol, took those steps?

This really did come up time and time again when talking to researchers on how they established trust in a paper. This lesson is a good opportunity to point out where in your institute researchers can get assistance with methodology and statistics, or relevant training.

Have you kept details of your literature review? While you may not be publishing all the details of your literature review, it can be helpful for your future self to retain these details. You may want to use part of this data for your next study, and need to remember why you discounted a paper, or if you felt there was bias unaccounted for in a study.


## Publishing your Protocol

Benefits to publishing your protocols:
 - Builds trust in your work
 - Enables discovery 
 - Expands your publication records
 - Offers an early opportunity for peer review, with an opportunity for feedback and improvements
 - It creates an early record of your novel methodologies, software, and/or innovations

Where can you publish your protocols?

[Protocols.io ](https://www.protocols.io/)
[PLOS](https://plos.org/protocols/)
Open Science Framework (OSF) - a free open source project management tool.  You can register all types of review protocols including scoping reviews. For instructions on how to submit, see Welcome to registrations.
[Cochrane Library](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/) - includes protocols of Cochrane Reviews that are planned or in progress. 

See [methods & protocols - ReproducibiliTeach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzpY4A5G70s&list=PLWb8IFSVeQ620plPweZIQSGQODpGOww8r&index=3) for the differences between protocol journals and protocol repositories (at 23:33).

## Preregistration
https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg#:~:text=What%20is%20Preregistration%3F,Both%20are%20important.

Prominent registries include:
OSF Registries. Run by the Centre for Open Science, OSF Registries is the most widely used repository for preregistering studies. Various templates are available for different kinds of preregistrations.
AsPredicted. AsPredicted is a preregistration platform created by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Credibility Lab, integrating with their ResearchBox platform.
protocols.io. A platform designed specifically for the preregistration of protocols and methods.
PreReg in Psychology. A long-running discipline-specific registry provided by the Leibniz Institute for Psychology (ZPID).
AEA RCT Registry. The American Economic Association’s Randomized Controlled Trials Registry is open to RCTs in economics, political science, and social science from anywhere in the world.
For clinical trials, there is a list of international registries in the Cochrane handbook.
