This [Project completion checklist](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Project_completion.md) may be helpful.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Does your institute have a 'Once your project is done' checklist?

May be worth checking with your library or research office.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 



## Deposit your final dataset and protocol/analysis pipeline

Let's get your work deposited so that others may access it.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Unsure about publishing your data and pipelines publically? Let's look at our options.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### FAIR vs Open vs Can't share

Firstly, if you can share your work openly - Great!

Prior to sharing, ensure you have clearly defined the licence, IP and attribution attached to your work.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Link to your organisation's IP/Copyright person.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

There are plenty of reasons you may not be able to share your data and pipelines as open access. 


https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/

Sharing under a data transfer agreement?
What does your ethics/governance/research contract say?

https://ardc.edu.au/resource/publishing-sensitive-data-guide/


#### Mitigating the risk when sharing data

https://github.com/cbahlai/OSRR_course/blob/master/15_sharing_data.md

Always include information about IP and copyright




### Where to deposit?

Deposit final state data to support your publications in an
institutional or discipline data repository which can mint a DOI and
create a citation for your work.

[Here is a helpful guide to choosing a data repository](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/guide-to-choosing-a-data-repository/)

Some repositories include:

 - [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)

 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

 - [Re3Data](https://www.re3data.org/)

 - [PLOSone Recommended Repositories](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories)

Can you also publish your raw data?

#### Publishing negative results

Positively Negative– a section of PLOS One specifically designed for studies that have negative results, but which are still of high quality and make a significant contribution to the field.

The Missing Pieces: A Collection of Negative; Null and Inconclusive Results– a section of PLOS One that is a broader collection of negative, null, and inconclusive results. The section accepts studies that do not meet the criteria for Positively Negative, but which still have the potential to be informative and valuable to the scientific community.

Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis

The All Results Journals– focuses on recovering and publishing negative results, valuable pieces of information in Chemistry, Nanotechnology, Biology, or Physics.


# What could you include when publishing

Wood-Charlson EM, Crockett Z, Erdmann C, Arkin AP, Robinson CB (2022) Ten simple rules for getting and giving credit for data. PLoS Comput Biol 18(9): e1010476. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010476

Have limitations of the study been noted and justified/discussed?

Reflective statements where the researchers consider how their own Bias /priviledges/worldviews may impact the findings

# Permanent Identifiers

### Identifiers vs Persistent Identifiers
#### What is the difference?

***An identifier*** is any label used to name an item (whether digital or physical). URLs and serial numbers are an examples of digital identifiers. Personal names are also identifiers, but are not necessarily unique as you may share the same name with other researchers around the world.

Examples of identifiers:

URL: https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services/hacky-hour would direct to the correct website.... until the team got renamed during a restructure.

Barcode: 32888493 may work in a lab, however may not be unique outside a lab. Or the product making the barcode may be discontinued.



***A persistent identifier*** is long-lasting unique digital reference to a webpage, digital object, even a person.

 - DOI
 - ORCID

This video from [Research Data Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqtiY7oZ6k) explains Persistant identifiers and data citation.

Let's go into these in more detail.

#### Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are used to uniquely identify digital research objects, and provide a persistent link to the location of the object on the internet. They also enable citation and tracking of citation metrics.

A DOI is a unique alphanumeric string that identifies content and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet. Metadata for that object is collected, including attributions, and attached to a DOI. 

They are the global standard for digital scholarly publications. 

A DOI looks like this: https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8v2n7

#### Minting DOI

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Include information around who mints DOIs at your organisation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

Often, your institute library will mint a DOI for you.

Journal publishers assign DOIs to electronic versions of individual articles & datasets.

In addition, [Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/article/220-create-dois) can mint a DOI for your repository.


#### ORCID - Identify a person

ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)[https://info.orcid.org/researchers/] provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. 

You can connect your iD with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more. You can use your iD to share your information with other systems, ensuring you get recognition for all your contributions, saving you time and hassle, and reducing the risk of errors.

An ORCID looks like https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0838-1771 .

# What is your next step?

::: tab 

### Beginner

A great place to start is:

Get yourself an ORCID id. This allows people to find and reach you easily. You can even include it in your email signature.


### Advanced

Your next move can be:
